# Micro Frontends Anti-patterns

Drawing on both established microservice anti-patterns and the analysis of real problems faced by software development teams that adopt Micro Frontends, this web application showcase a catalog of Micro Frontends Anti-patterns to foster community collaboration.

Anyone can update existing anti-patterns or contribute new ones to this project by following the guidelines specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Anti-patterns

Each anti-pattern follows the Mini-AntiPattern format (name, problem, and solution) and includes an example to illustrate the problem within an MFE context. Anti-patterns are classified into four categories:

- **Intra-fronted**: considers a single MFE component and its design.
- **Inter-frontend**: considers the structural division and communication involving two or more MFEs.
- **Operations**: related to the operational practices and continuous maintenance of the application.
- **Development**: related to the development team and their decisions around the architecture.
